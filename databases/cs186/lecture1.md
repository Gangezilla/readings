# Introduction to database systems

## Why take this class

- Very useful
  - Data processing backs every app incl databases
  - Principles back nearly all computing
  - Can get analytics information
  - Databases are important for the propagation of the human race (Tinder)
  - Science is increasingly being done through databases. First paradigm of science was experimental, second - theoretical, third - simulation, fourth - data intensive where you use sensing and large data storage to understand what's going on in the real world.
- In the 2000s there was a shift from programs to apps over data-centric storage
- More recently "full-stack" is becoming obsolete as more specialties pop up like Data science, data engineer.
- IT has also evolved, where data is increasingly handled in the cloud.

1. Utility
2. Centrality. Data is at the center of modern society. Data is very particular and voluminous. There's so much data. Data is central to a lot of discussion in sociey. 

**Privacy**

Starting mid 2000s we started seeing the word "database" appear on newspapers, never in a good way. They're very important to the functioning of society. 
It means if you get access to someone's Google account, you can see all their life basically.

**Data Integrity**

Not all data is correct, what implications does this have? For example, if enough users change an entry on Wikipedia and others agree with them, that becomes true.

DJ Patil (first Chief Data Scientist of US) called for a Code of Ethics for Data Science.

3. The core of computing

Data growth continues to grow and outpace computation.

Forces Driving Data Growth:

- Ubiquitous sensors and reporting. Cameras, mobile computing, blogging

Tehcniques you learn in this class unerlie many topics in computing
