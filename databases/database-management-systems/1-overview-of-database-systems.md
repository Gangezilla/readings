# Overview of Database Systems

A database is a collection of data consisting of entities and the relationships between them.

## Describing and Storing Data in a DBMS

A data model is a collection of high-level data description constructs that hide many low-level storage details.

A description of data in terms of a data model is called a schema.

When a user issues a query, the parsed query is presented to a query optimizer which uses info about how the data is stored to produce an efficient execution plan for evaluating the query.
