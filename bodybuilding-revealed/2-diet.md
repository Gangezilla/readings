# Diet

Brink's universal law of nutrition states total calories dictate how much you lose or gain, and macronutrient types and ratios dictate what you lose or gain.

Energy Intake = Energy Expenditure + Energy Storage

Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) can be split into 3 sections:
- Resting metabolic rate (RMR)
- Thermic effect of a meal (TEM)
- Energy expenditure of physical activity (EEPA)

## Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR)

RMR is associated with the energy cost of maintaining physiological homeostasis, meaning, maintaining body temp, cardiac output, nervous system function and other involuntary activities. The greater the amount of lean body mass you have, the greater your caloric expenditure even at rest.

Your metabolism is the rate at which your body burns calories to live. About 10% of your TDEE is used to convert food into fuel or fat, 20% is accounted for by exercises and everyday physical activities. However, 75% goes to RMR.

Because of this high percent, manipulating RMR is good. Best way to increase RMR is through weight training. Resistance training maintains RMR better than aerobics. After aerobic exercise, RMR returns to normal in an hour or so, but weights keeps RMR elevated for 15 hours.

## Thermic Effect of a Meal (TEM)

TEM is the energy increase that takes place after you eat a meal due to the cost of digestion, and storage of macronutrients. TEM depends on ratio of carbs, fats and proteins.

## Energy Expenditure of Physical Activity (EEPA)

EEPA is primarily driven by an individual's desire and ultimate performance of an activity.

TDEE helps us understand our calorie intake.

## Macronutrients: Protein Requirements

Active people should consume far more protein than the recommended daily amount to maintain hard-earned muscle tissue when dieting and to increase muscle tissue.

You should aim for at least 1g of protein per pound of body weight according to most research, but its ok to exceed this.

## Protein: Myths and Realities

Theres myths that too much protein stresses the kidneys. Research suggests that people with pre-existing kidney disease should avoid high protein diets, but no data has ever shown kidney functions to be compromised in healthy adults. Higher protein intakes do not appear to pose any health hazards, but may have health uses of their own.

## Macronutrients: Fat Requirements

The mentality of "fat is fat and should be avoided" is crap, cos there's a number of different types of fats.

Modern research shows that moderate fat intakes of the right types of fats have a place in the athlete's diet.

The right mix of hormones is needed to increase muscle mass and decrease body fat. A weightlifter with inadequate testosterone will find it impossible to add mass. Lots of people turn to roids when they should be looking at the effect macronutrients have on the production of anabolic hormones.

TLDR: Studies suggest that 30% of calories from fat appears to be the proper amount of fat needed.

### The one-third rule

One third of your fat allotment should come from unprocessed polyunsaturated fats with high omega-3 contents (flax, hemp, udo's choice, fish oils, nuts, fish). Another third can come from monounsaturated fats (olive oil, avocados etc, olives, peanut butter, almonds). The final third should come from saturated fats that are already found in red meat, whole milk, butter etc.

This ratio allows for optimal testosterone production, quality weight gain and performance without sacrificing your health in the progress.

## Macronutrients: Carb requirements

Carbs are whatevers left after fats and proteins. Choose carbs from the moderate and low GI lists, and use high GI carbs for pre and post-workout nutrition.

## Dividing Calories into Correct Meals

Divide your calories into 5-7 meals per day, timing nutrients is pseudoscience so what you care about is having a steady flow of nutrients throughout the entire day by properly dividing up your meals and sticking with it.

Generally, eat first thing in the morning and approx every 3 hours after that, using pre and post workout drinks and having a few bits of cottage cheese before bed.

## Pre/Post-workout & Nighttime nutrition

### Post workout nutrition

Immediately after a workout, you want to smash some high GI carbs. Studies have found its better when carbs and protein are mixed together over carbs alone.

Bodybuilders have done this for years, such as eating a bowl of white rice and drinking a protein shake, or corn flakes in skim milk and drinking a protein shake.

### Pre/During workout nutrition

The best solution is probably to do both: consume some carbs and protein immediately before and then after your workout is complete.

A formula containing 1g/kg of high GI carbs and 0.5g/kg whey protein split between your pre and post workout drinks. So for you right now:

80g carbs, 40g protein.
40g carbs, 20g protein pre and post workout.

Together these replace one of the 6 meals we eat each day.

Simply, mix 30-50g of whey protein with 75-100g of high GI carbs (glucose, maltodextrin) and 3-5g of creatine and drink half right before the gym, and half right after.

### Nighttime Nutrition

Small frequent feedings of high-quality protein maintain the amino acid levels needed to repair and build new muscle.

A snack before sleep is a wise precaution, but optional.

A good bedtime snack will contain about 30-50g of protein with minimal carbs, maybe with a small healthy fat to slow digestion even further.

## Summary

- Figure out your calories
- 30% of your calories should be fat, protein should be 1g per lb of body weight, fat should be the rest.
- Divide calories and macros between 5-7 meals per day.
- Eat your first meal right after waking up, additional meals should be eaten approx every 3 hours through the day.
- Follow pre and post workout nutrition recommendations and consume a small amount of slow digesting protein prior to sleep.
