# Nutrition

- It's super hard to not gain a bit of fat with muscle. The trick is to maximize adding lean body mass (LBM) while minimizing the addition of body fat.
- Body fat is a ratio, if you optimize LBM gains, you can cut the small amount of fat or put on more LBM.
- We can't change our genetics, but we can improve our nutrition and training.

## Macronutrient Basics: Protein

- There are approx ~20 amino acids that make up a protein (an amino acid is a chemical structural unit that makes up a protein). 8 are essential, and not something the body can make on its own.
- If you link several aminos together you get a peptide, and if you link peptides together you get a protein. Amino acids are the structural unit of a protein molecule.
- Protein is the only macronutrient that supplies nitrogen to drive lean tissue growth (anabolism). Athletes focus on the effect protein has on skeletal muscle, there are other disposal sites of amino acid nitrogen in the body. TLDR, there are many uses for protein unrelated to just building muscle.
- Protein is the macro least likely to turn into fat. Ingesting large amounts of protein can account for upward of 20% of daily energy expenditure.
- Good protein source are basically ones that are low in fat. Lean cuts of beef, whey, skinless chicken, tuna, turkey breast. Fats ok, but when we're choosing a protein source we want most of the calories to be from protein not fat.

## Macronutrient Basics: Fats

- Fats are pretty simple, they're just atoms of carbon linked together in a chain.
- Although much maligned, saturated fats do have a place in the diet of athletes.
- There are two essential fatty acids the body can't make, which are omega-3 (ALA) and omega-6 (LA). Fish oil contains omega-3, and a diet higher in omega-3 produces the best results for people looking to build muscle with minimum body fat.
- Fats are not all equal. Fats are inolved in thousands of bodily processes and have a number of health benefits.

## Macronutrient Basics: Carbohydrates

- Carbs, can be simple or complex.
- No such thing as essential carbs, the body can make its own by breaking down proteins.
- Digestion reverses the process, breaking down complex carbs into simple carbs and ultimately blood sugar which can be used for many different functions.
- The ability of a carb to raise blood sugar quickly or slowly is called the glycemic index (GI). The GI rating is based on how much blood glucose rises after consuming a carb over a 2 hour period.
- We use the glucose scale as a point of comparison. If you ate 50 grams of oranges, your blood glucose would rise 44% when compared to glucose.
- Carbs to eat brown rice, oats (but try to buy not quick), sweet potatoes, lentils, beans, veggies, fruit. These are all unprocessed or minimally processed, and are very high in fiber. If a carb is high in fiber, it'll generally have a lower GI than related low-fiber foods.

## Why is the GI important?

- The GI's importance relates to blood sugar's effects on insulin, the primary hormonal mediator of fat storage. The body uses insulin to control the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood, helps pull amino acids into cells, turns on protein synthesis in lean tissue.
- Controlling GI of meals allows a person to keep a steady and predictable blood sugar level, which can lower body fat, maintain energy levels etc.
- If you can manage insulin via GI correctly, you can add new muscle without adding a great deal of fat.

## Effects of GI on performance

Several studies have found that eating low GI foods, prior to endurance exercise results in more fat burned and improvements in performance.

On the flip side, beneficial effects have been observed when high GI sources are given immediately after exercise. High GI carbs, especially when combined with protein have positive effects.

Low GI foods tend to be more nutrient dense than high GI.

TLDR:
Low GI foods are better.
