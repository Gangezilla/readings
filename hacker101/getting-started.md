# Getting started

- 'requests' lib in python is good because you can send stacks of requests fast.

## Breaker mindset
- Break things before others can. Stop thinking like a defender and think like an attacker.
- Pushing a button is the fastest way to figure out what something does and give you an understanding of how something works.
- Defenders have to find every bug, attackers only need to find a few. This means attackers always have an advantage. Have to learn how to figure out what higher risk things are.
- When assessing an app, find every bit of functionality you can, then you can prioritise. Where will the highest payoff come from?
- Different levels of severity when you report bugs.
- Reflected XSS happens when an attacker gets a script to run on someone elses page. Think about all the times your input gets reflected, like, on Google imagine if any of the places your input is shown was wrong.
