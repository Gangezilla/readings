# Go quick-start
## Program Architecture
- A `main` function must be decalred for the build tools to produce an executable, and it becomes the entry point for the program.
- The main function exists within a package called `main`. If this doesn't exist, the build tools won't produce an executable.
- In fact, every code file in Go belongs to a package
- Imports import code, giving you access to identifiers such as types, functions, constants and interfaces. You can import from a standard library or from like a github link...?
- Is there no package manager?
