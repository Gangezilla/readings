# A Starters Guide to Pentesting with OWASP

OWASP - Open Web Application Security Project. Organisation that puts out articles.

- OWASP Top 10 changes every year and is a great way of figuring out what you should be learning about. This video series guides you through some of these.

## Injection

- Basically, we can send some input to an app that'll benefit us as an attacker. Putting in data that you shouldn't be allowed to get info.

## Broken AUthentication

Auth and session management, when an attacker can.
- Credential stuffing, useing a list of known passwords. If an app doesn't implement automated threat the app can be used as a password oracle to determine if the credentials are valid. No threat detection, just lets you pound a login form.
- Permitting weak passwords
- Given a session ID, your session ID stays the same and is constant. This is called session fixation.
- If you close the browser and come back.

## Sensitive Data Exposure

An app leaking info, like credit card numbers or passwords or something.

## XML External Entities (XXE)

Attacking an XML processor. XML processors not handling code correctly, so you can send out a file that exploits this.

## Broken Access Control

If a user is accessing something that they shouldn't be. Say we're a user with a bank account, I should not be able to see someone else's bank account. My authentication should be for me and me only.

## Security Misconfiguration

Bit of a catch-all. Lots of things, default credential login, or even a user that was unintended.
Unnecessary features are enabled like ports.
Say an error is generated, and that leaks info about the system, the OS, the stack traces... If we're not handling error messages correctly that's considered a security misconfiguration too.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Type of injection, often seen with JS. Abusing a feature that's not properly handled or sanitised so we can inject client side scripts into webpages. We can steal cookies, we can inject "beef hooks", deface a website... This is the second most common attack, in 2/3 of apps today.

- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- DOM XSS

## Insecure deserialization

Often over a request some info is turned into a byte string and sent over the wire and then converted. If this is done insecurely, info can be leaked and remote code execution can happen.

## Using components with known vulnerabilities

## Insufficient logging and monitoring.

Imagine an org that isn't logging things, or monitoring any attacks on their system. If an attacker gets in, how will the org know? This is a big big deal!!
