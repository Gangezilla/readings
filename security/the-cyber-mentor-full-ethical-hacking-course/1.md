# Overview

## Note taking

Does notes based off a company, takes notes about specific vulnerabilities that he's found. You want as much info as possible. The machine you're on, what time it was. Lots of screenshots. For reports, good to have borders, obfuscate stuff, draw borders. Recommends a tool called 'Greenshot'.

As a pentester you'll often have to rely on your notes. If you're on site, and you didn't record or get a screenshot or whatever then you're screwed.
