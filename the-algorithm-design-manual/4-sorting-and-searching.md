# Sorting and Searching

Sorting and searching comes up very often in computer science curriculum for a few reasons:
- Sorting is the basic building block that many other algorithms are built around. By understanding sorting, we obtain an amazing amount of power to solve other problems.
- Most of the interesting ideas used in algo design appear in the context of sorting, like divide and conquer, data structures, and randomized algos.
- Computers have historically spent more time sorting than doing anything else. A quarter of all mainframe cycles were spent sorting data.
- Sorting is the most thoroughly studied problem in comp sci.
