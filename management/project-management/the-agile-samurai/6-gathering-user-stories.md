# Gathering User Stories


- The problem with lots of documentaiton is customers dont really get what they want, and people in the business get pissed because things change.
- Short descriptions of features our customers would like to one day see in their software. A user story is the promise of a conversation.
- User stories have to make sense to business, which is why they're written in simple, approachable language. It means that when writing a story, you shouldn't use technical wording but should instead focus on the impact.
- As things change on projects, slicing stories up end to end and gathering them by feature enables us to treat our stories as independent and be flexible on scope when required.
- By making stories small (1 - 5 days) it's easier to fit them into sprints.
