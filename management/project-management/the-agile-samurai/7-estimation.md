# Estimation

- High level estimates are guesses, and they're typically inaccurate and overly optimistic. Estimates often lead into the 'cone of uncertainty'.
- Accurate up front estimates aren't possible. The only question they can attempt to answer is "is this project even possible with the time and resources we have?"
- We accept that our initial estiamtes aren't to be trusted, but we also understand that budgets need to be created and expectations need to be set. To do this, we build something, measure how long it takes and use that for planning going forward.
- To do this we need stories that are sized relatively to each other, and a point-based system to track progress.
- By having relatively sized stories and when we know how fast the team can go, we can begin setting expectations around dates.
- Point based systems let us do this relatively so the units don't matter. All we're trying to do is capture the "bigness" of a task. It doesn't really matter, as long as you size stories similarly to one another.
