# Chapter 1: Getting Started

- C is an imperative programming language. Imperative meaning, it looks like English so it's easier to understand it.
- The compiler translates the C text into something our machine understands.
- A correct C program is portable between different platforms.
- Portable means that wherever you run a particular program, its behaviour should be the same.
- C is designed to give computers orders. Thereby it mediates between us and computers.
- C must be compiled to be executed. The compiler provides the translation between the language that we understand and the specific needs of the platform.
- C gives a level of abstraction that provides portability. One C program can be used on many different architectures.
- The C compiler is there to help you.

# Chapter 2: The principal structure of a program

- Two categories of aspects to consider:

1. Syntactical aspects, how do we specify the program so the compiler understands it?
2. Semantic aspects, what do we specify so that the program does what we want it to do?

- Commas and semicolons are called separators or terminators. A comma separates the four arguments, and a terminator ends a line.
- All identifiers have to be declared. An identifier is anything like a variable, a type, functions, and constants.
- Identifiers follow a pattern. So an identifier followed by brackets `()` is a function, and one followed by square brackets `[]` is an array.
- Each declaration starts with a type.
- Identifiers may have several consistent declarations.
- Declarations are bound to the scope in which they appear.

- C distinguishes the lexical structure (punctuators, identifiers, numbers...), the grammatical structure (syntax), and the semantics (meaning) of programs.
- All identifiers (names) must be declared such that we know the properties of the concept they represent.
- All objects (things that we deal with) and functions (methods we use to deal with things) must be defined; that is, we must specify how and where they come to be.
- Statements indicate how things are going to be done: iterations (for) repeat variations of a task, functions calls delegate a task to a function, and function returns go back where we came from.
